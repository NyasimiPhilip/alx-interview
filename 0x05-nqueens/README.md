 <h1>N-Queens Solver</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>This Python script is designed to solve the N-Queens problem. The N-Queens problem is a classic puzzle where the goal is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.</p>

  <p>This script utilizes a backtracking algorithm to find and print all possible solutions to the N-Queens problem for a given board size N.</p>
  
  <pre><code>python3 nqueens.py N</code></pre>

  <p>Replace <code>N</code> with the size of the chessboard (the number of rows and columns) you want to solve for. <code>N</code> must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 4.</p>

  <p>The script will output all possible solutions to the N-Queens problem for the given board size.</p>
