  <h1>Lockboxes Algorithm Challenge</h1>
  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <p>You are presented with a set of locked boxes, numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1. Each box may contain keys to other boxes. Your task is to implement a method <code>canUnlockAll(boxes)</code> that determines if all the boxes can be opened.</p>
  <h2>Method Signature</h2>
  <pre><code>def canUnlockAll(boxes)
  </code></pre>
  <h2>Input</h2>
  <p><code>boxes</code>: A list of lists, where each list represents a box and contains positive integer keys. A key with the same number as a box can open that box. The first box <code>boxes[0]</code> is initially unlocked.</p>
  <h2>Output</h2>
  <p>Return <strong>True</strong> if all boxes can be opened; otherwise, return <strong>False</strong>.</p>
  <h2>Approach</h2>
  <p>The solution employs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to explore the connectivity between boxes through keys. The algorithm maintains a set of opened boxes (<code>opened_boxes</code>) and a list of new keys (<code>new_keys</code>). Starting with the initial key (0), it iteratively explores new keys found in each box until all boxes are opened or no more progress can be made.</p>
  <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
  <h3>Initialization:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><code>opened_boxes</code>: A set to keep track of the boxes that have been successfully opened.</li>
    <li><code>new_keys</code>: A list to store the keys discovered during each iteration. It starts with the key to the first box (box 0).</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Breadth-First Search:</h3>
  <p>The algorithm begins with the initial key (0) and explores the keys in each box. If a new key is found, it is added to <code>new_keys</code> for further exploration. The process continues until all boxes are opened or no more progress can be made.</p>
  <h3>Result:</h3>
  <p>The method returns <strong>True</strong> if all boxes can be opened; otherwise, it returns <strong>False</strong>.</p>
  <h2>Constraints</h2>
  <p>All keys are positive integers. There can be keys that do not correspond to boxes.</p>
  <h2>Example</h2>
  <pre><code>boxes = [[1], [2], [3], []]
  canUnlockAll(boxes)  # Returns True
  boxes = [[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]
  canUnlockAll(boxes) # Returns True
  boxes = [[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]
  canUnlockAll(boxes) #Returns False
  </code></pre>
